# OpportunityInsightsConnector Development Specification
**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Priority**: ðŸ”´ CRITICAL - Phase 4, Week 1-3  
**Complexity**: Tier 1 - Highest Complexity  
**Estimated Effort**: 3 weeks development + 1 week testing

---

## Executive Summary

The **OpportunityInsightsConnector** is the most complex connector in Phase 4-8, providing access to three major Opportunity Insights data products:

1. **Opportunity Atlas** - Intergenerational mobility by neighborhood
2. **Social Capital Atlas** - Economic connectedness and social capital
3. **Economic Connectedness** - Cross-class friendships and economic outcomes

**Domain Impact**: 
- D10 (Social Mobility) - 0% â†’ 100% coverage
- D21 (Social Capital) - 0% â†’ 100% coverage

**Why Build First**: Establishes architectural patterns for:
- Multi-source data integration
- Complex geographic aggregations (tract â†’ county â†’ CZ â†’ metro)
- Large dataset handling (100GB+ total)
- Multi-level parent/child income quintile matrices

## API Architecture

### Data Access Pattern
**Note**: Opportunity Insights does NOT have a REST API. Data access is via:
1. Direct CSV downloads from public URLs
2. Data stored on AWS S3 (public bucket)
3. Manual file management and caching

### Connector Design Pattern
```python
class OpportunityInsightsConnector(BaseConnector):
    """
    Connector for Opportunity Insights data products.
    
    Unlike most connectors, this does not use an API key.
    Instead, it downloads and caches CSV files from public URLs.
    """
    
    def _get_api_key(self) -> Optional[str]:
        # No API key required for public data
        return None
    
    def connect(self):
        # Initialize HTTP session for file downloads
        pass
    
    def fetch_opportunity_atlas(
        self,
        geography: str = "tract",
        metrics: Optional[List[str]] = None,
        state: Optional[str] = None,
        county: Optional[str] = None
    ) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Fetch Opportunity Atlas mobility data."""
        pass
    
    def fetch_social_capital(
        self,
        geography: str = "county",
        metrics: Optional[List[str]] = None
    ) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Fetch Social Capital Atlas data."""
        pass
    
    def fetch_economic_connectedness(
        self,
        geography: str = "county"
    ) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Fetch Economic Connectedness data."""
        pass
```

## Technical Challenges

### 1. Large Dataset Handling
**Challenge**: Opportunity Atlas is ~10GB uncompressed  
**Solution**: 
- Chunked file downloads
- On-demand loading by geography
- Efficient data filtering before loading full dataset
- Parquet conversion for faster loading

### 2. Geographic Aggregations
**Challenge**: Census tract â†’ County â†’ CZ â†’ State aggregations  
**Solution**:
- Use Census tract-to-county crosswalk files
- Use CZ definition files from Opportunity Insights
- Implement weighted aggregations by population
- Cache aggregation results

### 3. Multi-Source Integration
**Challenge**: Three separate data products with different schemas  
**Solution**:
- Unified geographic identifier system (FIPS codes)
- Common data structure with metadata
- Clear separation of concerns (one method per data product)
- Standardized column naming conventions

### 4. No API Key Management
**Challenge**: Public data, no authentication  
**Solution**:
- Override `_get_api_key()` to return None
- Implement HTTP session for file downloads
- Add user-agent headers for tracking
- Implement rate limiting on downloads

### 5. Data Version Management
**Challenge**: Data updates infrequently, need to track versions  
**Solution**:
- Add `data_version` parameter to methods
- Store version metadata in cache
- Implement version checking on download
- Document data vintage in responses

## Example Usage

```python
from krl_data_connectors import OpportunityInsightsConnector

# Initialize connector (no API key needed)
oi = OpportunityInsightsConnector()

# Fetch Opportunity Atlas data for California
ca_mobility = oi.fetch_opportunity_atlas(
    geography="tract",
    state="06",  # California FIPS code
    metrics=["kfr_pooled_p25", "kfr_pooled_p50", "kfr_pooled_p75"]
)

# Fetch Social Capital data at county level
social_capital = oi.fetch_social_capital(

- **Schema changes**: Data structure might change â†’ Mitigation: Schema validation

### Low Risk
- **Download failures**: Large files â†’ Mitigation: Resume capability, retries
- **Cache management**: Large cache size â†’ Mitigation: Configurable TTL
