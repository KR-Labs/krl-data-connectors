## Use Cases

### 1. Arts Infrastructure Economic Analysis
```python
connector = IRS990Connector()

# Analyze museums in New York
museums = connector.analyze_cultural_organizations(
    state='NY',
    subsector='museums'
)

# Calculate sector totals
total_revenue = museums['total_revenue'].sum()
avg_health_score = museums['financial_health_score'].mean()

print(f"Total museum revenue: ${total_revenue:,.0f}")
print(f"Average financial health: {avg_health_score:.1f}/100")
```

### 2. Nonprofit Financial Health Benchmarking
```python
# Get all arts organizations in California
ca_arts = connector.get_arts_nonprofits(state='CA')

# Calculate financial metrics
metrics = connector.get_financial_metrics(organizations=ca_arts)

# Identify high performers
excellent = metrics[metrics['financial_health_score'] > 80]
at_risk = metrics[metrics['financial_health_score'] < 50]

print(f"Excellent performers: {len(excellent)}")
print(f"Organizations at risk: {len(at_risk)}")
```

### 3. Cultural Subsector Comparison
```python
# Compare performing arts vs museums
performing_arts = connector.analyze_cultural_organizations(
    state='CA',
    subsector='performing_arts'
)

museums = connector.analyze_cultural_organizations(
    state='CA',
    subsector='museums'
)

# Compare average revenues
pa_avg = performing_arts['total_revenue'].mean()
museum_avg = museums['total_revenue'].mean()
```

### 4. Geographic Nonprofit Resource Distribution
```python
# State-level arts organization statistics
state_stats = connector.get_nonprofit_statistics(
    ntee_codes=['A'],
    group_by='state'
)

# Identify states with most arts resources
top_states = state_stats.nlargest(10, 'total_revenue_sum')
```

## Technical Notes

### Production Considerations

1. **API Integration**: Current mock implementation should be replaced with:
   - ProPublica Nonprofit Explorer API calls
   - IRS data direct integration
   - Rate limit handling (ProPublica has generous limits)

2. **Data Refresh**: IRS 990 filings are annual
   - Update frequency: Rolling as IRS processes returns
   - Historical data: Multiple years available
   - Lag time: ~6-12 months after fiscal year end

3. **NTEE Code Details**:
   - Major categories: A-Z (26 categories)
   - Subcategories: 3-digit codes (A50, A60, etc.)
   - Full classification: ~600+ specific codes

4. **Financial Calculations**:
   - Ratios based on IRS 990 Schedule I and Part IX
   - Industry benchmarks vary by subsector
   - Consider organization size in comparisons

### Known Limitations

1. Mock data approximates real ProPublica API structure
2. Financial health score uses simplified benchmarks
3. Multi-year trend analysis not yet implemented
4. Grant recipient tracking not included

### Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-Year Analysis**: Track financial trends over time
2. **Grant Network Analysis**: Map grant-maker/recipient relationships
3. **Compensation Analysis**: Executive compensation benchmarking
4. **Program Service Revenue**: Detailed program-level analysis
5. **Efficiency Comparison**: Peer group benchmarking tools
6. **Geographic Heatmaps**: Visual mapping of nonprofit resources
