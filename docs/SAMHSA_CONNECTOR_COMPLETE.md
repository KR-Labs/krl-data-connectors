**Key Features**:
- Treatment facility search with flexible filtering
- Substance abuse and mental health service analysis
- Service gap identification and coverage analysis
- Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) facility tracking
- Special population program identification
- Geographic service availability mapping

## Use Cases

### 1. Mental Health Service Availability Analysis
```python
connector = SAMHSAConnector()

# Find mental health facilities for veterans in New York
vet_facilities = connector.get_mental_health_services(
    state='NY',
    special_population='Veterans'
)

print(f"Veterans mental health facilities: {len(vet_facilities)}")
```

### 2. Substance Abuse Treatment Gap Identification
```python
# Analyze medication-assisted treatment availability
mat_facilities = connector.get_substance_services(
    state='CA',
    medication_assisted=True
)

# Identify service gaps
gaps = connector.analyze_service_gaps(state='CA')
underserved = gaps[gaps['service_gap_indicator'] == 'low']
```

### 3. Service Accessibility Research
```python
# Find facilities accepting Medicaid in rural areas
facilities = connector.find_treatment_facilities(
    state='WV',
    payment_options=['Medicaid', 'Sliding Scale']
)

# Analyze payment accessibility
payment_stats = facilities['payment_accepted'].explode().value_counts()
```

### 4. Specialized Program Analysis
```python
# Track adolescent treatment programs
adolescent_programs = connector.find_treatment_facilities(
    state='TX',
    service_type='both'  # Both substance abuse and mental health
)

adolescent_only = adolescent_programs[
    adolescent_programs['special_programs'].apply(lambda x: 'Adolescents' in x)
]
```

## Technical Notes

### Production Considerations

1. **API Integration**: Current mock implementation should be replaced with:
   - SAMHSA Treatment Locator API calls
   - NSDUH data integration
   - Real-time facility updates

2. **Data Refresh**: Facility data updates quarterly
   - Set up scheduled refresh pipeline
   - Handle facility closures/openings
   - Track service changes

3. **Special Handling**:
   - Privacy considerations for treatment facility data
   - HIPAA compliance for any patient data (not included in this connector)
   - Crisis hotline integration for referrals

4. **Performance**:
   - Implement caching for facility searches
   - Index by state/county for faster geographic queries
   - Batch processing for gap analysis

### Known Limitations

1. Mock data structure approximates real SAMHSA schema
2. List columns (services, payment, programs) need actual API structure
3. Geographic coordinates require geocoding service
4. Wait time and bed availability data not yet implemented

### Future Enhancements

1. **NSDUH Integration**: Add population prevalence data
2. **Crisis Services**: Integrate crisis center and hotline data
3. **Quality Metrics**: Add facility ratings and outcome measures
4. **Telehealth**: Track virtual/telehealth service availability
5. **Network Analysis**: Provider network and referral patterns
