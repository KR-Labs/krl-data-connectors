# Eviction Lab Connector Implementation Complete

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Connector**: EvictionLabConnector (Gap Analysis Connector #2)  
**Domain**: D27 - Housing Affordability & Gentrification (Housing Equity)  
**Status**: âœ… Complete - 7/7 contract tests passing

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented the **EvictionLabConnector** as the second of 12 strategic Gap Analysis connectors. This connector provides comprehensive access to the Eviction Lab database at Princeton University, enabling research on housing instability, displacement patterns, and the geography of eviction across America.

**Key Achievement**: Addressed critical domain gap - Housing Equity & Displacement (D27) was previously unrepresented in the baseline connector suite.

**Temporal Coverage**: 2000-2018 (annual observations)  
**Update Frequency**: Static historical dataset

### Core Methods Implemented

| Method | Purpose | Returns |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `connect()` | Initialize connector and validate data directory | None |
| `load_tract_data()` | Load tract-level eviction CSV with state filtering | DataFrame |
| `load_county_data()` | Load county-level eviction CSV | DataFrame |

---

## Use Cases Enabled

### 1. Housing Instability Research
```python
from krl_data_connectors.housing import EvictionLabConnector

eviction = EvictionLabConnector(data_dir='/data/eviction_lab/')
eviction.connect()

# Load tract-level data
tracts = eviction.load_tract_data('eviction_lab_tracts.csv')

# Identify eviction hotspots (>5% rate)
hotspots = eviction.get_high_eviction_areas(threshold=5.0)
print(f"High-eviction tracts: {len(hotspots):,}")
```

### 2. Displacement Pattern Analysis
```python
# Los Angeles County trends over time
la_trends = eviction.get_eviction_trends('06037', level='county')
print(la_trends[['year', 'eviction-rate', 'evictions']])

# Plot trend
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
la_trends.plot(x='year', y='eviction-rate', title='LA County Eviction Rate')
```

### 3. Comparative Geography Analysis
```python
# Compare major cities
comparison = eviction.compare_geographies(
    geoids=['06037', '17031', '36061'],  # LA, Cook, NYC
    level='county',
    metric='eviction-rate'
)
print(comparison)  # Year Ã— County pivot table
```

### 4. Policy Impact Evaluation
```python
# Load county data
counties = eviction.load_county_data('eviction_lab_counties.csv')

# National statistics before/after policy change
stats_2016 = eviction.get_eviction_statistics(year=2016, level='county')
stats_2018 = eviction.get_eviction_statistics(year=2018, level='county')

print(f"Mean eviction rate change: {stats_2018['mean_eviction_rate'] - stats_2016['mean_eviction_rate']:.2f}%")
```

## Domain Coverage Impact

### Analytics Model Matrix Progress

| Domain ID | Domain Name | Status | Connector |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| **D27** | **Housing Affordability & Gentrification** | **âœ… NEW** | **EvictionLabConnector** |

**Before Week 2**: 41 connectors â†’ 16/33 domains (48% coverage)  
**After Week 2**: 42 connectors â†’ **17/33 domains (52% coverage)**  
**Target**: 52 connectors â†’ 82% domain coverage (27/33 domains)

### Strategic Value

1. **Critical Research Gap**: Housing displacement was completely unmapped
2. **Policy Relevance**: Eviction moratoria, rental assistance, housing policy evaluation
3. **Equity Focus**: Demographic disparities in eviction patterns
4. **Geographic Detail**: Census tract granularity (finest available)
5. **Temporal Depth**: 18 years of annual data (2000-2018)

---

## Technical Quality

### Code Quality Metrics

- **Lines of Code**: 816 (533 connector + 283 tests)
- **Test Coverage**: 7 contract tests (100% passing)
- **Complexity**: Low-medium (file-based, comprehensive filtering)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings with policy context

### Design Patterns

1. **Multi-Level Geography**: Tract, county, state support
2. **Lazy Loading**: Data loaded on-demand via `load_*_data()` methods
3. **String Preservation**: GEOID fields maintain leading zeros
4. **Time Series Support**: Chronological sorting and trend extraction
5. **Threshold Filtering**: High-eviction area identification

### Notable Implementation Decisions

- **No API Key Required**: Eviction Lab data is public (academic research)
- `fetch()` method raises `NotImplementedError` (bulk downloads only)
- `_get_api_key()` returns `None` (interface compliance)
- Separate load methods for tract vs county data
- DataFrame caching in `_tract_data`, `_county_data`, `_state_data`

## Strategic Context

### Gap Analysis Roadmap

**Phase 4A: Strategic Connector Development** (Oct 22 - Dec 31, 2025)

| Week | Connector | Domain | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|--------|

| **2** | **EvictionLabConnector** | **D27 - Housing Equity** | **âœ… COMPLETE** |
| 3 | MITElectionLabConnector | D19 - Political Economy | ðŸ”„ Next |
| 4 | OpportunityInsights expansion | D10, D21 - Social Capital | Planned |
| 5-10 | 8 additional connectors | Various | Planned |

### Progress Summary

**Completed**: 2/10 weeks (20%)  
**Connectors Built**: 2/12 strategic (16.7%)  
**Total Connectors**: 42/52 (80.8%)  
**Domain Coverage**: 52% (17/33 domains)  
**On Schedule**: âœ… Yes

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Multi-Level Geography**: Tract/county/state flexibility valuable for research
2. **GEOID Preservation**: String dtype prevented data corruption
3. **Time Series Methods**: Trend extraction and comparison methods essential
4. **Threshold Filtering**: High-eviction area identification intuitive for users

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Numpy Type Handling**: Tests needed `np.number` and `np.integer` type checks
2. **Column Name Hyphens**: Eviction Lab uses hyphens (e.g., 'eviction-rate'), not underscores
3. **State Filtering**: FIPS mapping deferred (GEOID prefix filtering sufficient)

### Best Practices Established

- File-based connectors benefit from separate load methods by geography level
- Time series methods should enforce chronological sorting
- Comparison methods work well with pandas pivot tables
- Threshold-based filtering intuitive for policy research

## Research Context

### Eviction Lab Background

The Eviction Lab at Princeton University, founded by sociologist Matthew Desmond (author of *Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City*), maintains the first national database of evictions. The project has:

- **Processed 83 million court records** from all 50 states
- **Mapped evictions at census tract level** (finest geographic detail)
- **Revealed 2.3 million evictions annually** across America
- **Documented racial and geographic disparities** in eviction rates

### Policy Impact

This connector enables research on:
- **COVID-19 Eviction Moratoria**: Pre/post policy comparisons
- **Rental Assistance Programs**: Geographic targeting and effectiveness
- **Housing Instability**: Displacement and gentrification patterns
- **Demographic Equity**: Racial disparities in eviction vulnerability
- **Regional Variation**: State and local policy impacts

---

## Conclusion

The **EvictionLabConnector** successfully addresses the housing equity gap (D27) identified in the Analytics Model Matrix. This connector provides unique access to the most comprehensive eviction database in America, enabling critical research on housing instability, displacement, and policy effectiveness.

**Status**: âœ… Week 2 of 10-week strategic connector development complete.

**Next**: MITElectionLabConnector (Week 3) - Civic Engagement & Political Economy (D19)

**Achievement**: 2/12 strategic connectors complete (16.7%), 42/52 total connectors (81%), 52% domain coverage (on track for 82% target)
