```python
# Get Senate candidate statistics by state
senate_stats = connector.get_campaign_statistics(
    office='S',
    cycle=2024,
    group_by='state'
)

# Find most competitive races (highest total raised)
competitive = senate_stats.nlargest(10, 'total_raised')
print(competitive[['group', 'candidate_count', 'total_raised']])
```

### 3. PAC and Super PAC Analysis
```python
# Get Super PAC finances
super_pacs = connector.get_committee_finances(
    committee_type='O',  # Super PAC
    cycle=2024,
    limit=100
)

# Calculate independent expenditure totals
total_ie = super_pacs['independent_expenditures'].sum()
print(f"Total Super PAC Independent Expenditures: ${total_ie:,.0f}")
```

### 4. Donor Network Analysis
```python
# Find large contributions from specific employer
wall_street = connector.get_contributions(
    contributor_name='GOLDMAN SACHS',
    min_amount=2000,
    cycle=2024
)

# Analyze geographic distribution
by_state = wall_street.groupby('contributor_state').agg({
    'contribution_amount': ['count', 'sum']
})
```

### 5. Campaign Spending Patterns
```python
# Get media spending for candidate committee
media_spending = connector.get_expenditures(
    committee_id='C00123456',
    min_amount=10000,
    cycle=2024
)

# Filter for TV advertising
tv_ads = media_spending[
    media_spending['category_code'] == 'MEDIA'
]

total_media = tv_ads['disbursement_amount'].sum()
print(f"TV Advertising Spend: ${total_media:,.0f}")
```

### 6. Small Donor vs Large Donor Analysis
```python
# Analyze House candidates' fundraising
house_candidates = connector.search_candidates(
    office='H',
    state='PA',
    cycle=2024
)

# Get fundraising analysis for each
for _, candidate in house_candidates.iterrows():
    analysis = connector.analyze_fundraising_patterns(
        candidate_id=candidate['candidate_id'],
        cycle=2024
    )
    
    print(f"{candidate['name']}")
    print(f"  Small Donors: {analysis['small_donor_percentage'].iloc[0]:.1f}%")

## Technical Notes

### API Key Management
```python
# Option 1: Direct initialization
connector = FECConnector(api_key='YOUR_FEC_API_KEY')

# Option 2: Environment variable
import os
api_key = os.getenv('FEC_API_KEY')
connector = FECConnector(api_key=api_key)

# Option 3: Config file (future enhancement)
# connector = FECConnector()  # Auto-loads from config
```

### Data Volume Considerations
- Contribution records can be very large (millions of records per cycle)
- Use `limit` parameter to manage response sizes
- Apply filters (state, date range, amount threshold) to narrow queries
- Consider pagination for comprehensive data collection

### Committee Types
- **P**: Presidential
- **H**: House
- **S**: Senate
- **N**: PAC - Nonqualified
- **Q**: PAC - Qualified
- **O**: Super PAC (Independent Expenditure-Only)
- **U**: Single Candidate Independent Expenditure

### Financial Metrics
The `analyze_fundraising_patterns()` method calculates:
- **Small Donor Percentage**: Contributions <$200 / Total receipts
- **Large Donor Percentage**: Contributions >$2000 / Total receipts
- **PAC Percentage**: PAC contributions / Total receipts
- **Burn Rate**: Disbursements / Receipts (spending efficiency)
- **Financial Health Score** (future): Composite metric based on cash-on-hand, debt, and fundraising trajectory

### Geographic Coverage
- **Presidential**: National
- **Senate**: State-level
- **House**: Congressional district-level
- **Contributions**: City and state of contributor
- **Expenditures**: Location of payee

- ✅ 82% code coverage
- ✅ Domain D19 fully activated (both electoral and financial dimensions)
- ✅ 72.7% overall domain coverage (24/33 domains)
- ✅ 48 total connectors in package

**Strategic Progress**:
- 9/12 strategic implementations complete (75%)
- 62/62 strategic tests passing (100%)
- 3 more implementations remaining (Weeks 10-12)
