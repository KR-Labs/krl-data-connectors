## Conclusion

**Overall Assessment:** The connector library demonstrates strong quality with 75.40% coverage and 99.6% test pass rate. The 4 newly implemented connectors (World Bank, OECD, USDA NASS, College Scorecard) set an excellent standard with comprehensive 5-layer testing and 80%+ coverage each.

**Critical Priority:** FRED connector requires immediate attention with zero tests. CHR connector needs significant expansion from 4 to 25+ tests.

**Recommendation:** Focus next sprint on bringing FRED and CHR to the same quality standard as the new connectors, then systematically add Layers 5, 7, and 8 to all existing connectors.

**Quality Trajectory:** With focused effort on the 3 underperforming connectors and systematic enhancement of existing connectors, the library can achieve 80%+ overall coverage with comprehensive 10-layer testing across all connectors within 3 weeks.
