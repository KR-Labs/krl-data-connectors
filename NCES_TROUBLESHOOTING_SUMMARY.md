# NCES Notebook Troubleshooting Summary

**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Issue**: Missing data and no visualizations in NCES quickstart notebook  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

---

## Problems Identified

### 1. Missing Abstract Methods (CRITICAL BUG)
**Issue**: All Week 13 connectors couldn't be instantiated  
**Error**: `TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class NCESConnector without an implementation for abstract methods 'connect', 'fetch'`  
**Fix**: Added `connect()` and `fetch()` stub methods to all 4 Week 13 connectors  
**Commit**: 85a63fc

### 2. Incorrect API Endpoints
**Issue**: Enrollment and graduation endpoints returning 404 errors  
**Root Cause**:
- Enrollment endpoint required grade specifier (`/grade-3/`)
- Graduation endpoint was pointing to wrong URL (finance instead of EDFacts)

**Fixes**:
- Changed enrollment to use directory endpoint (includes enrollment data)
- Fixed graduation to use EDFacts `/schools/edfacts/grad-rates/{year}`  
**Commit**: 30b480a

### 3. Data Availability Issues
**Issue**: No data returned for demographics, performance, finance (2023)  
**Root Cause**: Data lag and wrong data sources

**Fixes**:
- Demographics: CCD directory doesn't include demographics → explained CRDC source
- Performance: Test scores not in directory → explained EDFacts source  
- Finance: 2023 not available → changed to 2021 (most recent)
- Graduation: 2023 not in EDFacts → changed to 2019

### 4. No Visualizations
**Issue**: Notebook had no charts or graphs  
**Fix**: Added comprehensive matplotlib visualizations

---

## Solutions Implemented

### ✅ School Distribution Dashboard (4 panels)
1. **Schools by City** - Top 15 cities with most schools
2. **Charter vs Non-Charter** - Pie chart showing 86.6% non-charter, 13.4% charter
3. **Schools by Level** - Bar chart of Elementary, Middle, High, etc.
4. **School Status** - Distribution of open/closed status

### ✅ Enrollment Visualizations (2 panels)
1. **Top 15 Schools** - Horizontal bar chart
   - Largest: Cranston High School West (1,698 students)
   - Smallest in top 15: Warwick Veterans Middle (1,129 students)
2. **Enrollment Distribution** - Histogram with statistics
   - Mean: 441 students
   - Median: 361 students
   - Range: 48 - 1,698 students

### ✅ Data Availability Documentation
Added clear notes explaining:
- Why demographics aren't in CCD directory (use CRDC instead)
- Why performance data isn't available (use EDFacts assessments)
- Data lag timelines (finance: 2 years, grad rates: variable)
- Alternative data sources for each category

### ✅ Working Data Years
- **School Directory**: 2023 ✅ (320 schools)
- **Enrollment**: 2023 ✅ (305 schools with data)
- **Finance**: 2021 ✅ (most recent available)
- **Graduation Rates**: 2019 ✅ (EDFacts availability)

## Results

### Before
- ❌ Connector couldn't instantiate
- ❌ No enrollment data
- ❌ No graduation data  
- ❌ No demographics/performance
- ❌ Zero visualizations
- ❌ Confusing error messages

### After
- ✅ Connector initializes successfully
- ✅ 320 schools retrieved
- ✅ 305 schools with enrollment data
- ✅ 6 comprehensive visualizations
- ✅ Clear data availability notes
- ✅ Working examples with proper years
- ✅ Statistical summaries

## Technical Details

### Urban Institute API Structure
```
https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/{topic}/{source}/{endpoint}/{year}/[grade_or_other_specifiers]/[filters]
```

**Key Learnings**:
1. Some endpoints require specifiers (e.g., `/grade-3/` for enrollment by grade)
2. Directory endpoints include aggregate enrollment without specifiers
3. Different data sources have different lag times
4. CCD, CRDC, and EDFacts are separate systems with different data

### Data Sources Explained

| Data Type | Source | Endpoint | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------|-------|
| School Directory | CCD | `/schools/ccd/directory/{year}` | Includes aggregate enrollment |
| Demographics | CRDC | `/schools/crdc/enrollment/{year}` | Biennial (every 2 years) |
| Test Scores | EDFacts | `/schools/edfacts/assessments/{year}` | State-specific |
| Graduation Rates | EDFacts | `/schools/edfacts/grad-rates/{year}` | Lags 3-4 years |
| Finance | CCD | `/school-districts/ccd/finance/{year}` | District-level, lags 2 years |

### Code Quality Improvements
- Added proper error handling with data availability messages
- Implemented visualization best practices (titles, labels, legends)
- Added statistical summaries alongside visualizations
- Used `display()` for better DataFrame rendering in notebooks
- Added data validation (NaN filtering, column existence checks)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Interactive Visualizations** - Use Plotly for hover tooltips
2. **Demographic Dashboard** - When CRDC data integrated
3. **Performance Trends** - Multi-year comparisons
4. **Geographic Maps** - School locations with folium
5. **Comparison Tools** - Compare RI to other states
6. **Export Dashboard** - PDF reports with all visualizations

### Data Integration Opportunities
1. Combine CCD + CRDC for complete picture
2. Add EDFacts assessments for performance metrics
3. Multi-year trend analysis (2015-2023)
4. Cross-reference with SAIPE (poverty estimates)
5. Link to College Scorecard for post-secondary outcomes
