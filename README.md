## Installation

Install KRL Data Connectors via pip. The package supports optional and development dependencies for advanced use cases.

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install krl-data-connectors

# With all optional dependencies
pip install krl-data-connectors[all]

# Development installation
pip install krl-data-connectors[dev]
```

## Quick Start

This section demonstrates how to initialize and use key connectors. Each example is designed for clarity and immediate integration into institutional workflows.

### County Business Patterns (CBP) Connector

```python
from krl_data_connectors import CountyBusinessPatternsConnector

# Initialize connector (API key from environment: CENSUS_API_KEY)
cbp = CountyBusinessPatternsConnector()

# Get retail trade data for Rhode Island
retail_data = cbp.get_state_data(
    year=2021,
    state='44',  # Rhode Island FIPS code
    naics='44'   # Retail trade sector
)

print(f"Retrieved {len(retail_data)} records")
print(retail_data[['NAICS2017', 'ESTAB', 'EMP', 'PAYANN']].head())
```

### LEHD Origin-Destination Connector

```python
from krl_data_connectors import LEHDConnector

# Initialize connector
lehd = LEHDConnector()

# Get origin-destination employment flows
od_data = lehd.get_od_data(
    state='ri',
    year=2021,
    job_type='JT00',  # All jobs
    segment='S000'     # All workers
)

print(f"Retrieved {len(od_data)} origin-destination pairs")
print(od_data[['w_geocode', 'h_geocode', 'S000', 'SA01']].head())
```

### FRED Connector

```python
from krl_data_connectors import FREDConnector

# Initialize connector (API key from environment: FRED_API_KEY)
fred = FREDConnector()

# Fetch unemployment rate time series
unemployment = fred.get_series(
    series_id="UNRATE",
    observation_start="2020-01-01",
    observation_end="2023-12-31"
)

print(unemployment.head())
```

### BLS Connector

```python
from krl_data_connectors import BLSConnector

# Initialize connector (API key from environment: BLS_API_KEY)
bls = BLSConnector()

# Get unemployment rate for multiple states
unemployment = bls.get_series(
    series_ids=['LASST060000000000003', 'LASST440000000000003'],
    start_year=2020,
    end_year=2023
)

print(unemployment.head())
```

### BEA Connector

```python
from krl_data_connectors import BEAConnector

# Initialize connector (API key from environment: BEA_API_KEY)
bea = BEAConnector()

# Get GDP by state
gdp_data = bea.get_data(
    dataset='Regional',
    method='GetData',
    TableName='SAGDP2N',
    LineCode=1,
    Year='2021',
    GeoFips='STATE'
)

print(gdp_data.head())
```

### Using the Base Connector

All connectors inherit from `BaseConnector`. The base class provides standardized caching, configuration, and logging capabilities.

```python
from krl_data_connectors import FREDConnector

# Automatic caching
fred = FREDConnector(
    api_key="your_api_key",
    cache_dir="/tmp/fred_cache",
    cache_ttl=3600  # 1 hour
)

# Cached responses are automatic
data1 = fred.get_series("UNRATE")  # Fetches from API
data2 = fred.get_series("UNRATE")  # Returns from cache

# Check cache statistics
stats = fred.cache.get_stats()
print(f"Hit rate: {stats['hit_rate']:.1f}%")
```

## Architecture

KRL Data Connectors are architected for extensibility and operational precision. Each connector extends `BaseConnector`, which standardizes logging, configuration, caching, and request management across all sources.

### BaseConnector

`BaseConnector` implements the following infrastructure features:

- **Structured Logging:** JSON-formatted logs with request and response metadata.
- **Configuration Management:** Supports environment variables and YAML-based configuration.
- **Intelligent Caching:** File-based and Redis caching with configurable TTL.
- **Error Handling:** Automatic retries, API rate limiting, and timeout management.
- **Request Management:** HTTP session pooling and connection reuse for efficiency.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from krl_core import get_logger, ConfigManager, FileCache

class BaseConnector(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for data connectors."""
    
    def __init__(self, api_key=None, cache_dir=None, cache_ttl=3600):
        self.logger = get_logger(self.__class__.__name__)
        self.config = ConfigManager()
        self.cache = FileCache(
            cache_dir=cache_dir,
            default_ttl=cache_ttl,
            namespace=self.__class__.__name__.lower()
        )
        # ... initialization
```

## API Keys Setup

KRL Data Connectors automatically detect API keys using multiple secure methods, ensuring seamless integration in both production and development environments. For comprehensive instructions, refer to [API_KEY_SETUP.md](./API_KEY_SETUP.md).

### Quick Setup

API keys are resolved in the following order:

1. **Environment variables** (recommended for production deployments)
2. **Configuration file** at `~/.krl/apikeys` (recommended for development)
3. **Direct assignment in code** (not recommended for production)

#### Option 1: Environment Variables (Recommended)

```bash
export BEA_API_KEY="your_bea_key"
export FRED_API_KEY="your_fred_key"
export BLS_API_KEY="your_bls_key"
export CENSUS_API_KEY="your_census_key"
```

#### Option 2: Configuration File (For Development)

```bash
# Create config file
mkdir -p ~/.krl
cat > ~/.krl/apikeys << EOF
BEA API KEY: your_bea_key
FRED API KEY: your_fred_key
BLS API KEY: your_bls_key
CENSUS API: your_census_key
EOF
chmod 600 ~/.krl/apikeys
```

KRL Data Connectors will automatically detect and use this file if present.

#### Obtaining API Keys

| Service           | Required?    | Registration URL                                      |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **CBP/Census**    | Optional     | https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html           |
| **FRED**          | Yes          | https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html     |
| **BLS**           | Recommended* | https://www.bls.gov/developers/home.htm               |
| **BEA**           | Yes          | https://apps.bea.gov/api/signup/                      |
| **LEHD**          | No           | N/A                                                  |

*BLS is accessible without a key but with reduced rate limits (25 vs. 500 requests/day).

### Using Config Utilities

The package provides utilities for automatic config discovery:

```python
from krl_data_connectors import find_config_file, BEAConnector

# Automatically locate the config file
config_path = find_config_file('apikeys')
print(f"Config found at: {config_path}")

# Connectors will use the config file or environment variables if available
bea = BEAConnector()
```

## Configuration

KRL Data Connectors support flexible configuration via environment variables and YAML files. This enables precise control over API keys, caching, and logging for institutional deployments.

### Environment Variables

Define environment variables to configure API credentials, caching, and logging:

```bash
# API Keys
export CENSUS_API_KEY="your_census_key"
export FRED_API_KEY="your_fred_key"
export BLS_API_KEY="your_bls_key"
export BEA_API_KEY="your_bea_key"

# Cache settings
export KRL_CACHE_DIR="~/.krl_cache"
export KRL_CACHE_TTL="3600"

# Logging
export KRL_LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
export KRL_LOG_FORMAT="json"
```

### Configuration File

Alternatively, use a YAML configuration file for advanced customization:

```yaml
fred:
  api_key: "your_fred_key"
  base_url: "https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred"
  timeout: 30

census:
  api_key: "your_census_key"
  base_url: "https://api.census.gov/data"
  
cache:
  directory: "~/.krl_cache"
  ttl: 3600
  
logging:
  level: "INFO"
  format: "json"
```

Load and apply the configuration in your workflow:

```python
from krl_core import ConfigManager

config = ConfigManager("config.yaml")
fred = FREDConnector(api_key=config.get("fred.api_key"))
```
