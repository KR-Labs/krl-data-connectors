3. **Reusable Patterns:** BaseConnector inheritance streamlined implementation
4. **Clear Documentation:** Quickstart notebooks provide immediate value for users
5. **Git Hygiene:** Single well-documented commit keeps history clean

### Challenges Overcome
1. **API Variations:** Each connector required different data access patterns (file vs API vs hybrid)
2. **Data Formats:** Handled CSV, Excel, JSON, and API responses with appropriate parsing
3. **Geographic Filtering:** Implemented flexible filtering across different geographic levels
4. **Statistical Calculations:** Added growth rates, affordability, per-pupil spending calculations

### Best Practices Established
1. **Consistent Method Naming:** `load_*`, `get_*`, `calculate_*` patterns
2. **Comprehensive Docstrings:** Full parameter documentation and examples
3. **Structured Logging:** JSON-formatted logs with context
4. **Intelligent Caching:** Minimize API calls while ensuring data freshness
5. **Type Safety:** Type hints throughout for IDE support
