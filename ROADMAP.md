5. **Community Requests**: User-requested connectors (via GitHub issues)

## Quality Standards

Every connector must meet:

- ‚úÖ Type-safe implementation with full type hints
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive docstrings (Google style)
- ‚úÖ 90%+ test coverage (unit + integration)
- ‚úÖ Example Jupyter notebook
- ‚úÖ API documentation (Sphinx autodoc)
- ‚úÖ Error handling with custom exceptions
- ‚úÖ Automatic response caching
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting and retry logic
- ‚úÖ Logging integration

## How to Request a Connector
